		<h1>verse 1</h1>
		<div class="verse">
			<p>Tell me what you gon' do to me<br>
				Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me<br>	
				You can bring a bullet, bring a sword<br>
				Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me<br>	
				Fuck you and all your expectations<br>
				I don't even want your congratulations<br>
				I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation<br>
				I hate people that feel entitled<br>
				Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you<br>	Oh, you important?<br>
				You the moral to the story, you endorsing?<br>
				Motherfucker, I don't even like you<br>
				Corrupt a man's heart with a gift<br>
				That's how you find out who you dealin' with<br>
				A small percentage, who I'm building with<br>
				I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning<br>
				On my momma that's the realest shit<br>

				Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
				Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>

		<h1>verse 2</h1>
		<div class="verse">
			<p>Skin covered in ego<br>
				Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound<br>
				No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down<br>
				It's a turn on, get it away from me<br>
				Know you mean wrong, keep away from me<br>
				And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah<br>
				I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason<br>
				I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'<br>
				I did it all 'cause it feel good<br>
				You could live it all if you feel bad<br>
				Better live your life<br>
				We are running out of time<br>
